## What Can It Do?
You'll want to use this script if you are looking for a way to allow your viewers to request instant replays from your chat. This script will listen to chat and wait for the number of requests to exceed your set threshold within a set window of time (30s). When it does, it will automatically change your OBS scene for the duration of your replay then return to the original scene.


## Installation
1. Download as [a .ZIP](https://github.com/iBroadband/auto-instant-replay/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. Extract to your local scripts folder (e.g. `C:\Users\iBroadband\AppData\Roaming\Streamlabs\Streamlabs Chatbot\Services\Scripts`)
3. Open Streamlabs Chatbot and go to the Scripts tab. `Right Click > Reload Scripts`


## Setup
1. Set up an instant replay scene on OBS. [Here is a good resource](https://youtu.be/7fi7RI4y_6o) from Defrag on Youtube.
2. Make sure you have a hotkey assigned that switches to your replay scene.
3. In `Script Settings > OBS Settings` update the following:
    - `OBS Replay Hotkey`
    - `Base Scene`
    - `Instant Replay Scene`
    - `Replay Duration`
4. The default settings will work out of the box for the rest. Adjust them as needed.


## Settings

###### The most basic settings
---
##### Command
The chat command your viewers can use to request a replay.
- **default**: `!replay`

<br />

### OBS Settings
###### Settings related to (SL)OBS and your scenes

##### OBS Replay Hotkey
The hotkey you use to switch to your instant replay scene in OBS.

##### Base Scene
The name of the scene you want to switch from.

##### Replay Duration
The duration of your instant replay buffer in seconds.

## Known Issues
none, it's perfect ðŸ˜Ž

- Planned improvement: add a setting for window size in case users want shorter or longer windows to allow for requests.
